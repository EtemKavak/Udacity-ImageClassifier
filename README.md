## Deep Learning
• ```Challenge```: Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project for deep learning module titled as 'Image Classifier with Deep Learning' attempts to train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice we had to train this classifier, then export it for use in our application. We had used a dataset (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories.
<br>
• ```Solution```: Used torchvision to load the data. The dataset is split into three parts, training, validation, and testing. For the training, applied transformations such as random scaling, cropping, and flipping. This will help the network generalize leading to better performance. Also need to load in a mapping from category label to category name. Wrote inference for classification after training and testing the model. Then processed a PIL image for use in a PyTorch model. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project: <br>
    1) NumPy
    2) pandas
    3) Sklearn / scikit-learn
    4) Matplotlib (for data visualization)
    5) Seaborn (for data visualization)
<br>
• ```Result```: Using the following software and Python libraries: Torch, PIL, Matplotlib.pyplot, Numpy, Seaborn, Torchvision. Thus, achieved an accuracy of 80% on test dataset as a result of above approaches. Performed a sanity check since it's always good to check that there aren't obvious bugs despite achieving a good test accuracy. Plotted the probabilities for the top 5 classes as a bar graph, along with the input image.
